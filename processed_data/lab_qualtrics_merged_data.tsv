If they are premature (&lt; 37 weeks of gestation) or with reported hearing or developmental delay, we are not using their data. We may occasionally invite these excluded infants so that they can participate in a study as a thank you for their parent volunteering. These data are not kept in the final dataset.  We initially contact the parent/carer by its preferred method, email of phone. In the email, we briefly explain the aim of the study and the procedure, offering them to reply to us with a suggestion for a time and date that would suit them and their child's rhythm (especially for young infants, we ask them to choose a time when their child would typically be ""happy""). The information and consent forms are attached. If we have no response, we usually call the parent 3-4 days after the initial email.

When an experimenter is looking to test infants from a specific age group, he/she will pick out roughly 200 infants from the list who fit the age criteria and send them a recruitment letter.  This is our exclusive form of recruitment.  If caregivers agree to be added to our database, they may be contacted at a later date to participate in a different experiment. For this Many Babies, we may use many children from the database, because the response rate of these parents is much higher and we can screen for the eligibility criteria.	"Once parents have received the letter, they contact the experimenter or lab manager.  A quick summary of the experiment is given and if the parents have any questions, they are addressed at this time. Parents are reassured that the procedure is not dangerous and that they will be with their infant the entire time. They are asked for the child's birthday, name, and the parent's general contact information. In our typical recruitment, language background is noted (% exposed to each language). For Many Babies, we will also ask on the phone for length of gestation (37+ weeks is our cut-off) and whether the child has normal hearing.  Regarding whether the child is ""typically developing"", this is rather strange to ask on the telephone in France.  Typically, if the child has an atypical development, parents volunteer this information (e.g. reduced gray matter, blood transfusion, surgery, etc.). For Many Babies, we will ask a general question regarding the child's development and then follow up for more details at the experiment appointment."	6	NA	NA	NA	NA	Diploma with their picture	1	NA	NA	NA	We do not have RAs in our laboratory.

We also ask participating parents to give us contact information of other families with babies in similar age range.  The percentages vary quite a bit, but I'd say that the most of the babies we got so far, were through word of mouth - friends of mothers, who came to the lab. We do not do an initial screening, but we ask questions about the infant's development / health in our questionnaire and  if the baby does not meet our criteria for inclusion, we exclude the data of that baby after testing.	We do not have an initial screening process. We only collect information about the baby's gender and date of birth and decide whether to schedule the baby based solely on these two pieces of information. We collect these through various means I described in the previous section. Once the family is in, we give them a questionnaire that asks about whether the baby is full-term, typically developing, and has normal hearing. In addition, because most studies we conduct in the lab involves music perception, we ask whether the baby has frequent ear infection, whether there is a history of hearing problems in the family, whether the baby is exposed to unusual noise and whether he or she has cold on the day of testing. In addition, we ask some questions about the baby's language and music exposure. For the IDS study, we will be using the questionnaire provided.	6	NA	NA	NA	NA	We give a certificate and either a t-shirt or a bib	6	NA	NA	NA	In our lab, only graduate students test infants. Because all ongoing studies in the lab require online coding, students go through a training and they have to become reliable in coding eye-gaze before starting testing infants. For this, we have a detailed written protocol about how to set up each infant study and how to code eye gaze. As a first step, students are asked to read this carefully. Then, students and I first go through 1-2 experimental session videos from previous studies that were coded by me and I explain the technical details of the procedure. Then they have to code 3-4 videos that were previously coded. Some of these videos are more difficult to code than others (e.g., the infant is not very stable etc). Students' coding has to agree with at least 90% of the frames in all these videos. So far, I only had 2 graduate students who are involved in infant testing and both passed this training successfully. After this, students observe me while setting up and testing 3-4 babies. After this, they test at least 2-3 babies while I am present. If everything goes well, they start testing alone and they are assisted by an undergraduate RA. I also check the videos of the first couple of babies they test and code online to see if there are any problems.	They have to code at least 3 videos from previous experimental sessions and have to agree at least on 90% of the frames. Then they have to watch while I (or another experienced researcher in the lab) test 3-4 babies. After this point, if the student feels ready to test babies, she/he can start testing under my supervision. If everything seems ok, I let the graduate students test infants by themselves with the help of an undergraduate RA. The graduate students who will be testing infants for the manybabies project have already tested about 20-30 babies each.	3	NA	NA	1	NA	Habit	3	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	2	NA	NA	NA	NA	1	NA	NA	2	NA	NA	1	SONY - MDR-ZX110 Noise-cancelling headphones	1	NA	NA	NA	1	1	1	234	I will send the sound decibel level separately as an email.	2018-07-03T02:07:38Z	2018-07-03T02:53:11Z	1	R_TjiyWjGOODf1ieJ	bounbcl	Gaye Soley	1234	ManyBabies1: bounbcl	NA	1	We started data collection slightly later than expected due to construction taking place  in the lab.

They rarely test infants on their own. In most cases, infants are tested by researcher who is the primary author of the study (PhD students/postdocs, at times also junior faculty) assisted by an RA. Exceptions are when: (1) the researcher speaks Hungarian and thus does not need assistance of an RA, (2) RA tests on her own (currently all RAs are female), because of researcher's illness or travel, but only if this is agreed on in advance, (3) a procedure is developed with involvement of the RA and researcher is not needed at all for data collection (e.g. because the procedure relies on an interaction between a toddler and Hungarian-speaking RAs). Consequently over the course of their employment RAs gain extensive training in assisting with and sometimes running-first hand various methodologies.  For ManyBabies we follow this standard model of data-acquisition at CDC. Most babies will be tested by MIkołaj Hernik (Associate Research Fellow with over 9 years of infancy research) assisted by an RA with over 3 years of experience in assisting with  (and occasionally running) infants studies at CDC, including working with the EyeLink eyetracker.  The procedure of ManyBabies was piloted with about 10 12-15-month-olds in order for both the researcher and the RA to get acquainted with procedure elements not common in our typical procedures (e.g. blinding mums with headphones) and to get a sense of older-babies behavior in the task.  When the researcher (MH) is not available for testing, some babies may be tested by the RA, who typically assists in the study, assisted by an RA in training.	See previous answer. Typically an RA is has already considerable experience running some infant paradigms. If the method is new, the study is often preceded by a small pilot which may last until the procedure goes smoothly. RAs in training typical start by shadowing experienced RAs and then start assisting with a limited number of studies.	1	NA	EyeLink 1000 Plus, Experiment Builder	3	NA	NA	3	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	2	NA	NA	1	NA	2	Phillips SHP2000	NA	1	NA	NA	1	Phillips SHP2000	2	NA	NA	NA	5	5	4	124	I am aware I skept some answers now (specifically: audio levels).

Once they become comfortable with coding, they will run 10-15 ""practice"" babies under supervision of a trained experimenter.  Trained experimenters will verify accuracy by checking videos of the ""practice"" babies."	Although there is not typically a lot of conversation during an actual experiment, one of the criteria we use to determine a new experimenter is ready to test babies is whether they can participate in an unrelated conversation while they code a baby's looking behavior accurately.  To our mind, this indicates that the coding process has become automatized and the new experimenter is ready to test babies.

We always ask the following screening questions: - Has your child had any ear infections in the last 12 months? - How many days before or after their due date was your child born?  - Does your child hear any languages besides English on a regular basis? If so, how many hours per week (of non-English language)?  - Does your child have any hearing or vision concerns?  In our lab, our *typical* practice is to treat babies as ""practice"" participants (i.e. exclude them from our sample), if one of the following is true: - They have had 4 or more ear infections in the last 12 months. - They were born 28 days or more before their due date (36+ weeks gestational age) - They have had 10 hours + per week of language exposure other than English. - There are significant concerns regarding vision or hearing.

After each video, reliability of their coding responses is checked via comparison of overall left and right looking button press times to the coding key. RAs should achieve 95% agreement with the key. The training videos are subsequently discussed with an experienced Head Turn coder (typically the lab manager) to allow for questions and look at differences and identify any issues.

On the phone, we ask parents to estimate their children’s percent exposure to each language over their lifetime, and ask about any health concerns.  Only once infants come to the lab, parents complete additional questionnaires that include specific questions about gestation, hearing, and developmental problems, and to complete a structured interview that estimates language exposure.

For undergraduate students, this phase typically lasts for several months.  Exceptional undergraduates (mostly honours track students) and graduate students are then trained by the lab manager on how to test infants.  Students begin by reading lab instruction documents regarding questionnaires, interacting with parents, equipment, etc.  They then complete mock test sessions with the lab manager, taking increasing level of independence.  Once they are able to follow lab protocol in mock tests sessions to a high level, they begin leading the test sessions for real infants while accompanied by an experienced tester who provides support and gives feedback.  Once the other testers and lab manager are satisfied that the prospective tester follows lab protocols, they begin testing on their own.  Training refreshers are provided each semester for all students who test infants.	Consensus from lab manager, testers, and the PI that the new RA is able to follow lab protocols.

If the lab manager is unavailable, the same training is provided by a “senior” graduate student.

As part of the training, the first 2/3 online coding performed by the RA are reviewed offline by the senior researcher and the RA using the video recordings of the testing sessions.	The senior researcher decides if/when the RA is ready to test babies, and not all RAs are allowed to test (those who are not are typically allocated to recruiting procedures, parents’ consent, and offline coding). The RA is judged to be ready to test when he/she is able to manage the technical lab setup for the study and the online coding of looking times.

No sample screening occurs during this process.	Once a family fills out our participation form (https://faculty.unlv.edu/ehannon/participate.html), a Research Assistant follows up with an email thanking them for signing up. We then let them know that we will follow up with a phone call within 5 business days if their child is eligible for one of our current studies. The only screening we do at this time is based on their age. Occasionally we have a family message us on Facebook or email us directly, rather than filling out our Participation form. In this case we usually we collect a phone number or correspond via email with them in order to gather information about their child (i.e. Name, age, contact info for family). We add the child's information to our Participant Database (created using Filemaker Pro), which then allows us to sort based on age to select children who are eligible for our studies. We create a call list, which Research Assistants complete each day. Then, we call the family and schedule an appointment with them. We also send a confirmation email once the appointment is made, and we do confirmation calls 24 hours before the appointment.	12356	We have a parking spot designated for our research lab, where families can park for free.	"Infants receive a onesie with our ""UNLV Music Lab"" logo on it, a baby item (i.e. bib, bottle, baby toy, baby book, etc.), stuffed animal, or beanie hat (with lab logo)"	NA	This occasionally happens if the parent/caregiver is a psychology student enrolled in PSY101.	Every child receives a Child Scientist Degree (First lab visit: Bachelor's, Second lab Visit: Masters, Third Lab Visit: PhD, Fourth Lab Visit: Post Doc...up through Full Professor)	17	NA	NA	A graduate student is always present during infant training, but Research Assistants often help with a significant part of the testing, provided they are appropriately trained.	RAs attend a day-long training day at the beginning of the semester each semester (both new and returning RAs), where we detail general lab procedures (i.e recruitment, calling procedures), as well as specific training on how to run experiments (i.e. habituation paradigms, such as Many Babies 1). RAs trained on infant studies are first trained on how to code videos from looking time paradigms. They 1) watch a training video, 2) sit one-on-one with an expert while coding a video, 3) independently code a video, and 4) have their independent coding verified by an expert. Once they are sufficiently trained on coding pre-recorded videos, we train RAs on how to code videos live. RAs shadow a graduate student live-coding an infant study at least three times, and then they are shadowed while they code an infant live. A graduate student oversees all training and is present at all times during testing.	Graduate students carefully monitor training and are charged with deciding when an RA is ready to test babies. The RA must demonstrate attention to detail and accuracy when coding pre-recorded infant videos before being okayed to run Many Babies 1. Then, they must shadow a graduate student running the study at least 3 times before performing any live-coding. Finally, once the graduate student feels the RA is sufficiently trained, s/he is allowed to code infant looks during an experiment. RAs never run infant studies by themselves; a graduate student is always present.	3	NA	NA	1	NA	Habit (presents the experiment), 2 cameras (ELP 1megapixel HD USB Camera w/ Day/Night Vision), Camtwist (streams two cameras into a single video), Quicktime (records video), Macintosh operating system	3	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	2	NA	NA	NA	NA	2	Sennheiser Headphones	NA	4	Room is adjoined to our main lab space, but is separate with a door.
