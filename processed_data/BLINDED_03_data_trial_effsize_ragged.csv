Just prior to the mailing, we ask the state vital records office to verify that no infants have died since we received the birth records. If any have, we do not mail to those parents. Ten to 15 percent of parents agree to participate. Parents indicate their interest in participating by returning a postage-paid postcard with their contact information.","For this study, we are asking the following question by phone prior to scheduling an appointment. If the infant is not eligible for this study, we have other studies we can refer them to.   What languages does your baby hear in the home? What percentage of time is each language spoken in front of your baby? [If the second language is spoken 25% of the time or more, refer the parent to other studies they might be eligible for.]  Was your baby born early? [If so] How early? [If more than two weeks, the baby is not eligible. Refer the parent to other studies they might be eligible for.]  Does your baby have any medical diagnoses? [If so] What is the diagnosis? [If the baby has any diagnoses that you are not sure would exclude the baby from this study or not, tell the parent you need to ask Dr. Lundwall and will call them back. Some examples of diagnoses that would be problematic are: Deafness, blindness, Angelman Syndrome, Cri du Chat Syndrome, Down Syndrome, Fragile X Syndrome, Klinefelter Syndrome, Neurofibromatosis, Prader-Willi Syndrome, Rett Syndrome, Smith Magenis Syndrome, Turner Syndrome, Velocardiofacial Syndrome, Williams Syndrome, or XXX Syndrome.
